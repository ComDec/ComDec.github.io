Hi there! My name is **Xi Wang**. Currently, I am a PhD student at the Courant Institute in New York University and NYU Shanghai, working under the supervision of Shengjie Wang. My research interests lie in developing innovative machine learning models (Generative Models) to tackle scientific challenges, particularly in the fields of biology and chemistry.


# Research Interest

## AI for Science
My work focuses on applying AI to biology and organic chemistry. Specifically, I am interested in addressing the **hallucination problem** in deep learning models. In *AI for Science* research, hallucination can be particularly detrimental, as it often violates the moral, physical, or chemical principles that govern these domains. My goal is to improve the reliability of AI systems in scientific applications.

## Computational Biology
Computational biology is a complex discipline that focuses on using computational methods to solve problems in biological sciences. My work specifically centers on biological macromolecules, with a focus on the structure and function prediction of **proteins, RNA, and antibodies**. I utilize pre-trained models to enhance the predictive accuracy and generalization performance in downstream tasks.

## Molecules Design
Chirality is a fundamental property of nature, as it influences both the proteins that make up living organisms and the drugs that cure diseases. My research focuses on a special class of chiral molecules known as **geometrically chiral molecules**. Unlike centrally chiral molecules, these molecules create a chiral environment by forming asymmetric three-dimensional "pockets". Such chiral molecules have significant applications in pharmaceuticals and catalysis. I integrate **quantum chemical calculations, pre-trained models, and diffusion models** to develop new models for addressing related challenges.
