Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis, whereby all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters can be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this Minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules.
